It drops to 10 \u03bcA in \u201cnot enabled\u201d mode.On chip trimming results in high output voltage accuracy (2%).

The device incorporates a dual monolithic high-side driver (HSD) and two lowside switches. The HSD switch is designed using STMicroelectronics proprietary VIPower\u2122 M0 technology that efficiently integrates a true Power MOSFET with an intelligent signal\/protection circuit on the same die.The low-side switches are vertical MOSFETs manufactured using STMicroelectronics proprietary EHD (\"STripFET\u2122\") process.The three circuits are assembled in a MultiPowerSO- 30 package on electrically isolated lead frames.This package, specifically designed for the harsh automotive environment, offers improved thermal performance thanks to exposed die pads.Moreover, its fully symmetrical mechanical design provides superior manufacturability at board level.The input signals IN<Sub>A<\/Sub> and IN<Sub>B<\/Sub> can directly interface with the microcontroller to select the motor direction and the brake condition. Pins DIAG<Sub>A<\/Sub>\/EN<Sub>A<\/Sub> or DIAG<Sub>B<\/Sub>\/EN<Sub>B<\/Sub>, when connected to an external pull-up resistor, enable one leg of the bridge. They also provide a feedback digital diagnostic signal. The CS pin monitors the motor current by delivering a current proportional to its value. The speed of the motor can be controlled in all possible conditions by the PWM up to 20 kHz. In all cases, a low level state on the PWM pin will turn off both the LS<Sub>A<\/Sub> and LS<Sub>B<\/Sub> switches. When PWM rises to a high level, LS<Sub>A<\/Sub> or LS<Sub>B<\/Sub> turn on again depending on the input pin state.","keyFeatures":"<ul><li>Current-sense output proportional to motor current<\/li><li>Protection against loss of ground and loss of V<Sub>CC<\/Sub><\/li><li>Package: ECOPACK<Sup>\u00ae<\/Sup><\/li><li>Very low standby power consumption<\/li><li>Linear current limiter<\/li><li>5V logic level compatible inputs<\/li><li>Overvoltage clamp<\/li><li>Undervoltage and overvoltage shutdown<\/li><li>Cross-conduction protection<\/li><li>PWM operation up to 20 kHz<\/li><li>Thermal shut down<\/li><\/ul>","partNumber":"VNH3ASP30-E","parent":"VNH3ASP30-E","title":"Automotive fully integrated H-bridge motor driver"},{"description":"The device is a double channel high-side driver\n manufactured using ST proprietary VIPower<Sup>\u00ae<\/Sup> M0-7 technology and housed in PowerSSO-16 package.

The device incorporates a dual monolithic high-side drivers and two low-side switches. The high-side driver switch is designed using STMicroelectronics\u2019 well known and proven proprietary VIPower<Sup>\u00ae<\/Sup>M0 technology that allows to efficiently integrate on the same die a true Power MOSFET with an intelligent signal\/protection circuit.The three dice are assembled in MultiPowerSO-30 package on electrically isolated lead-frames. This package, specifically designed for the harsh automotive environment offers improved thermal performance thanks to exposed die pads. The input signals IN<Sub>A<\/Sub>and IN<Sub>B<\/Sub>can directly interface to the microcontroller to select the motor direction and the brake condition.The DIAG<Sub>A<\/Sub>\/EN<Sub>A<\/Sub>or DIAG<Sub>B<\/Sub>\/EN<Sub>B<\/Sub>, when connected to an external pull-up resistor, enable one leg of the bridge. They also provide a feedback digital diagnostic signal. The CS pin allows to monitor the motor current by delivering a current proportional to its value when CS_DIS pin is driven low or left open. The PWM, up to 20 KHz, lets us to control the speed of the motor in all possible conditions. In all cases, a low-level state on the PWM pin turns-off both the LS<Sub>A<\/Sub>and LS<Sub>B<\/Sub>switches.
